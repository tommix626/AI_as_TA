some prompts here

NOTE to Feilian:

The General Prompt Structure looks like:

System: xxx_system_instruction (this is the variable in this file)

(then the few shot section, can directly modify the variables in this file)
User: (few shot prompt user1)
Assistant: (few shot prompt assistant1)

User: (few shot prompt user2)
Assistant: (few shot prompt assistant2)

User: (few shot prompt user3)
Assistant: (few shot prompt assistant3)

User: (few shot prompt user4)
Assistant: (few shot prompt assistant4)

User: (Where the real input is, taken cared by the framework code)

And the whole thing is sent to the OpenAIAPI for completion, for each model.

TODO @Feilian closely verify the prompt of each model, finalize the few-shot prompting (follow examples of constructor if you don't know what is the goal)
TODO @Feilian add few shot example (may be very simple: http_get -> openAI) [LOW priority Do this After you finish other stuff.]

**Final Judgment**: Conclude with your overall judgment on whether the instructor’s idea is feasible under the current toolkit provided.

        Email Summary: Lastly, use the email sending function provided by the HTTP POST APIs to distribute this summary to all students enrolled in the course. This step entails crafting an informative email that includes the summary and using the email API to send it to the list of student email addresses associated with the course.
