Please do a specific analysis for idea overview, API capabilities, integration challenges, technical feasibility, recommendations.
Conclude with your overall judgment by giving a detailed workflow.
You should be working hard to find out a way to make it work. If you feel a certain functionality is missing, ask yourself if you can decompose that task into several step, where the smaller steps can be implemented with the current toolkit. Be creative!
The format of the output should always starting with "YES, the idea is feasible" , and then provide a detailed instruction ON the workflow, the working pipeline, on how to proceed with this idea by using the current available tech stack.
